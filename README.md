## System Architecture & Features

Grievance.ai transitions city management away from slow manual filing by offering three highly specialized web portals secured with **Neon Auth's OpenID Connect (OIDC)** identity system:

### 1. The Citizen Hub
* **AI-Guided Submission:** File civic issues with automatic department auto-tagging, severity assessment, and title optimization.
* **Global Leaderboards:** Engagement metrics celebrating citizens who contribute actively to community resolutions.
* **Community Portals:** Interactive maps and live boards detailing localized complaints and ongoing infrastructure operations.

### 2. The Officer Workspace
* **AI Intelligence Center:** Interactive natural language workspaces equipped with automated summarizers, routing recommendations, and dispatch triggers.
* **Operational Queue:** Dynamic Kanban boards with real-time status syncing via Socket.io channels.
* **Leaderboards & Auditing:** Metrics assessing departmental turnaround times, accuracy, and case closure efficiency.

### 3. The Admin Command Center
* **Operational Dashboards:** Premium charts and real-time telemetry analyzing total complaints, resolution rates, and departmental load metrics.
* **Citizen Management:** Advanced table operations for citizen roles, verification overrides, and identity auditing.
* **System Settings:** Centralized toggle boards managing regional routing rules, notification triggers, and API integrations.

## Behind the Scenes: Asymmetric AI Orchestration
* **Secure JWT Middleware:** Performs high-speed cryptographic signature verification natively against Neon's **Ed25519 (EdDSA)** OIDC elliptic curve key sets (JWKS).
* **Automatic Database Synchronizer:** Features a self-healing user onboarding engine that translates OIDC session claims directly into Postgres relational records on-the-fly.
* **FastAPI Model Spaces:** Connects municipal dispatchers to distributed classification layers hosted on Hugging Face Spaces for offloaded, high-throughput text analytics.
